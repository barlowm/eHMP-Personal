/*
All applet styling should be done in SASS format.  Any current CSS files will be ignored after October 6th, 2014.
To ensure that current applet styles are kept and updated, if you haven't already please go and create a ".scss" file in the following folder:
[applet]/assets/sass

Once created, the SASS file will be used during the applet's build task to create css styling for your applet.
For more information/documentation on SASS please visit their website at: http://sass-lang.com/
